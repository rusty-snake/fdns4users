# fdns4users

Allow unprivileged users to start fdns.

## Getting started

First install [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then execute the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/rusty-snake/fdns4users.git
cd fdns4users
cargo build --release
install -D -m 4755 -o root -g root target/release/fdns4users /usr/local/bin/fdns4users
```

:rotating_light: This adds a new [suid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid#Security)-executable to your system. :rotating_light:

You can now start using it, here an example.

```
fdns4users --whitelist=debian.org &
firejail --dns=127.70.74.68 wget "https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso"
```

Please note that it is so far not possible to change `--proxy-addr`.
Therefore you can only start one fdns instance via fdns4users.

## Alternatives

Instead of a own suid-exeutable you can use polkit or sudo.

**Example for sudo:**

Attention:
 - Only edit sudoers if you know what you do!
 - Read the relevant parts of the manpage!
 - Always use `visudo`!
 - Keep a root-shell open to undo mistakes, so you won't get locked out.

Allow the user `john` to start `fdns --proxy-addr=127.70.74.<digit between 0 and 9>` via sudo.

`/etc/sudoers.d/40-fdns`:
```
john ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/fdns --proxy-addr=127.70.74.[0-9]
```
